<h1>What Does a Librarian Do?</h1>
</header>
<br>
    <p id="fant">Being a librarian/information specialist is more than straightening dusty books on a shelf. It’s about providing people free and easy access to information, both factual and enriching. That could
    mean an online journal article, a DVD, access to a specialist in the field, a puzzle, a streaming
    documentary, and yes, even a book or two. A library is a safe and comfortable place where people learn
    and discover, and there are libraries for everybody, whether they are a member of a community, a
    student nurse, or a researcher. It’s my job to make sure they have free and easy access to this
    information. The less time you spend searching for something, the more time you have to enjoy it.</p>
<p>George Carlin once said, “A house is just a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff”. It certainly feels that way when you have collections, whether they are books, records, games or rocks. Like a library, your home is a safe and comfortable place where you can learn and discover what is most important to you. Your collections say a lot about you- your interests, experience, and values. A home library should be just that; a library in your home. Libraries are places for expressions of freedom, and when the things that you are passionate about aren’t easy to get to or find, it can feel like you’re missing a part of yourself.</p><br>
<h3 id=h3final>Final Thoughts:</h3>
<p>Librarians love to help others discover and learn, and our beliefs are akin to those of educators. There’s nothing more enjoyable than seeing someone learn, whether it’s a first time experience, an “I had no idea this even existed”, or just having a simple question answered. I love creating spaces where people can learn or just escape with a good book.</p><br>
