<h1>Experience</h1> 
<br>
<p>My experience includes work with the public, students, and researchers. Through these positions, I have become familiar with the resources needed for a diverse group of individuals. Whether it’s finding a
board book for a baby or a Cochrane Review for a researcher, I have learned about a wide range of
subjects and know the best way to make them accessible. I keep up with trends in children and teen
literature, and even if I might not know the more minute details of complex subjects such as medicine, I
always know where to look in order to retrieve the information needed.</p>
