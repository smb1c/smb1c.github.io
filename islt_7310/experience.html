<p id="exppara">My experience includes work with the public, students, and researchers. Through these positions, I have become familiar with the resources needed for a diverse group of individuals. Whether it’s finding a board book for a baby or a Cochrane Review for a researcher, I have learned about a wide range of subjects and know the best way to make them accessible. I keep up with trends in literature, and even if I might not know the more minute details of complex subjects such as medicine, I always know where to look in order to retrieve the information needed.</p>

<li>St. Peter’s Nursing College<br>
Library Assistant 2012 – Present<br>
<ul>
<li>Assisting students with databases and research</li>    
<li>Collection management</li>
<li>Working with vendors, participating in conferences and webinars dealing with issues related to library</li>
</ul>
<p>At St. Peter's Nursing College, I've honed my research skills and I am fluent in several of the major medical databases. One of my jobs is to teach students how to find information in this myriad of resources. Sometimes that means giving one on one lessons, making brochures and handouts, and or trying to explain everything via email. Project 1 is a straightforward tip list that I've given out. Students have complimented me on how well I explain things, and this demonstrates that skill.</p>

<section> 
<li>Lyon University<br>
Library Assistant 2016 – 2018<br>
<ul> 
<li>Assisting students with databases, research, and APA formatting</li>
<li>Collection management</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of what I did at Lyon University is what I currently do at St. Peter's, but I got to research a broader range of subjects than just nursing. I don't have a project from this college job, but I have a small sample of some Excel projects that I started when <b>I</b>was college. This shows how detail-oriented and organized I have can be when keeping records.</p>

<section> 
<li>Deacon Library, Ellisville Branch<br>
Youth Services II 2008 – 2010<br>
<ul>
<li>Planning and executing programming for children and teens</li>    
<li>Assisting patrons with reader’s advisory and answering reference questions   </li>   
<li>Keeping up with current trends in children’s and teen literature</li>   
<li>Working with schools and community centers as part of the library’s outreach programs</li>   
</ul>
<p>I haven't always worked with college students- I worked many years in the public library system, specifically working with children and teens. Children and teens are a very different audience, and one has to stay on top of trends and interests and have knowledge of child development. Project 3 is a children and teen display  that I made for Banned Book Week. This is a demonstration of my creativity and design skills.</p>
