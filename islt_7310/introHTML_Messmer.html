My name is Sarah and this is my final class for the program! When it comes to previous coding experience, I’ve used Scratch (a kid-friendly program to introduce basic coding concepts). I completed the HTML tutorial from CodeAcademy.com, and only STARTED CS50, the freely available online Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard. I was only able to complete the first week’s “water bottle calculator” example; however “Mario” and the other project had me stumped. I’m hoping to improve upon the few coding experiences I have had and I’m looking forward to creating a designed functional webpage. It has been interesting taking a step back and learning the differences in terminology that I’ve probably used interchangeably in the past (URL and domain name for example). In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons, organizing my libraries, (both digital and physical), and attending pop culture conventions when I can.
