<h3>About Me</h3><br>
<p id="para">Some people meditate. I find my zen in a pile of books or a list of titles. I find happiness in a straightened shelf or organized ebook files. I have been working in libraries since I was sixteen and enjoy learning about a number of different subjects. I have worked with children, teens, adults, students, and faculty, providing reader’s advisory and organized material for them. Formats I’ve worked in include Dewey Decimal System, Library of Congress, and National Library of Medicine. I’ve curated attractive collections and displays, so not only will your collection be organized in a way that you can understand, it will look good with your home decor.  I’m skilled in the use of programs like Excel, Calibre, and Book Crawler for cataloging usage. My hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons, reading (usually fantasy, sci-fi, or graphic novels), and video games.</p><br>
